SQL Music Store Analysis

Project Description:
This project focuses on the analysis of a music store database using SQL queries. It aims to gain insights into various aspects of the music store's operations, including sales, customers, artists, and genres. The project is divided into three sets of questions: Basic, Moderate, and Advanced, each designed to explore different facets of the dataset.

Technologies Used:
-SQL (Structured Query Language)
-MySQL Workbench

Instructions
Setup
Ensure you have a SQL database system installed. You can use MySQL Workbech or any other SQL-compatible database system of your choice.

Create a new database for this project and import the provided SQL script containing the music store dataset. You can do this using command-line tools or a database management tool like DBeaver, phpMyAdmin, or MySQL Workbench.
